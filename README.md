# A-Multi-Stream-Bi-Directional-Recurrent-Neural-Network-for-Fine-Grained-Action-Detection
The multi-stream network uses two different streams of information (motion and appearance) for each of two different spatial croppings (full-frame and person-centric) to analyze short chunks of video. One network (CNN-T) computes features on pixel trajectories (motion), while the other (CNN) computes features on RGB channels (appearance).
